## What are LLM-Brained GUI Agents?

**LLM-Brained GUI Agents** are:

> **Intelligent agents that operate within GUI environments, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as their core inference and cognitive engine to generate, plan, and execute actions in a flexible and adaptive manner.**

These agents are at the forefront of AI research, aiming to make interactions with graphical user interfaces more natural and efficient.
